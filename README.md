Daily UI Challenge: #001

Prompt: Sign Up

Create a sign up page, modal, form, or app screen related to signing up for something. It could be for a volunteer event, contest registration, a giveaway, or anything you can image.

I wanted to keep this simple for my first challenge - while ensuring I created a fun, responsive and effective design. I built the sign-up form using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, aiming for clean and fun design. I added a creative google font to add interest to the page without distracting from the main needs of gathering information from the user. I like how this turned out and it was an easy little project to practice my skills.

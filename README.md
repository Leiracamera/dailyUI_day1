Daily UI Challenge: #001

Prompt: Sign Up

Create a sign up page, modal, form, or app screen related to signing up for something. It could be for a volunteer event, contest registration, a giveaway, or anything you can image.

I wanted to keep this simple for my first challenge, combining my design skills with HTML, CSS and use of Bootstrap. I designed a clean and simple sign in form using contrasting and bold colors. I added a creative google font to add interest to the page without distracting from the main needs of gathering information from the user. I like how this turned out and was a quick and easy little project.
